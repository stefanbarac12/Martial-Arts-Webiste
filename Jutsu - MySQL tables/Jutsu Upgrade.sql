INSERT INTO `training_plan` VALUES (1,1,'<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Introduction to Shaolin Wushu</h1><p>- Wushu, in the Cantonese dialect of the Chinese language, generally means martial art, though in its wide sense, the term may be used to mean any art. But amongst Chinese martial art experts, the term \"wushu\" in its strict technical meaning, is actually used to refer to only one field or area of Chinese martial art, that of training skills or force. In the Chinese language the most equivalent term for \"martial art\" is \"wushu\". The transcription here and elsewhere in the book follows traditional Chinese (Mandarin) unless the transcribed term is already established. In Cantonese pronunciation, the transcription is \"mou shirt\".</p><p>- For the convenience of practicing the art, \"wushu\" can be classified into seven major areas:</p><ol><li>Set Practice</li><li>Combination Practice</li><li>Specific Techniques</li><li>Force Training</li><li>Sparing</li><li>Weapons</li><li>Principles</li></ol><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Set Practice</h1><p>- A kungfu set is a series of pre-arranged kungfu patterns linked together with some specific purposes. In some styles of kungfu, like Hoong Family Kungfu, there are many kungfu sets, while in others, like Tai Chi Chuan, there is only one basic set. Set Practice is a fundamental element in kungfu training, but it is not the only important element, as many people erroneously believe. The primary aim of Set Practice is to enable students to know and perform correctly variously kungfu movements or patterns.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Combination Practise</h1><p>- After knowing how to practise kungfu patterns correctly, students must learn how to use them for combat. It is not enough that the students merely learn the combat functions of kungfu patterns from oral explanation of an instructor. The students themselves must practise the uses many, many times so that they can apply the kungfu patterns flawlessly when needed. This can be realised through Combination Practice. Here two or more students practise together various techniques of attack and counters, and in order for the students to remember the movements and combinations well, the attack and defence techniques are logically arranged to form a Combination Set.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Specific Techniques</h1><p>- Specific Techniques refer to kungfu techniques used to overcome specific combat situations. For example, if someone holds me from behind, I release the hold by using an appropriate kungfu pattern. This pattern is a specific technique against that particular holding attack. Patterns used in Specific Techniques are taken from complete kungfu sets, and the techniques are generally practised individually.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Force Training</h1><p>- Force Training is a poor substitute for the Chinese term \"kungfu\". Technically, kungfu means an ability to perform a pattern or patterns excellently, usually with force and speed, and this ability is the result of prolonged, consistent and repeated practice. This ability is usually referred to as \"kung\", for example, iron palm kung, tiger-claw kung, chi kung, and ching kung. Thus, merely practising kungfu sets or knowing some specific techniques against certain combat situations, strictly speaking, is not kungfu.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Sparring</h1><p>- Sparring is the logical sequence of Set Practice, Combination Practice and Specific Techniques, and is primarily aimed at preparing students for actual combat. Sparring can be pre-arranged or free, and can be between two persons or amongst many people. Sparring needs to be learnt and practised methodologically; a person without proper pre-requisite training will not be able to make effective use of the kungfu techniques he has previously learnt in sparring.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Weapons</h1><p>- Practising with weapons is an important aspect of kungfu training. In the past, when weapons could be carried about freely and therefore frequently used in fighting, weapon training naturally was often given more emphasis than unarmed combat. Shaolin disciples, for example, were well known for their excellent use of the staff. Although carrying a weapon is now illegal, weapon training still has its functional value. The procedure in practising a weapon is generally the same as in unarmed kungfu: a student first learns a weapon set, and its uses, then practises Combination Set and Specific Techniques with the weapon, and finally trains force or kung using the weapon and practises sparring.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Principles</h1><p>- The practice and application of kungfu are guided by general as well as specific principles. And if we understand the underlying principles, we can not only perform kungfu with insight, but also achieve better result with less time and effort. Knowing the principles often makes the difference between a novice (no matter how long he may have practised the art) and a master. His knowledge of kungfu principles will enable the master to view with perception and appreciation any form of martial art he sees, although he may not have learnt it before.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">History of Shaolin Wushu</h1><p>- Many people are under the impression that Kung Fu originated with the Shaolin Temple. It did not. Read on to get the details.</p><p>- In fact the Shaolin temple did become a centre of development for the martial arts and remained so for more than a thousand years before it was dissolved by the Ching Dynasty in the Eighteenth Century. As a side note the Shaolin Temple is situated at the foot of the \'\'Songshan\'\' mountain in Dengfeng County, Honan Province. It should also be said that there have been many Shaolin Temples built all around China. Whether these were set up as competitors to the temple at Songshan or represented an extension of the original Shaolin Temple is not known.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Da Mo (Bodhidharma) </h1><p>- In the year 527 AD, a monk known as Da Mo (Bodhidharma) arrived at the Shaolin Temple. Dat Mo is belived to have been an Indian monk who was probably born in Kanchipuram near Madras. Da Mo travelled to the city of Kuang, now known as Canton, where he was granted an audience with the Emperor at the time, Wu Ti of the Liang Dynasty. The Emperor had instructed local Buddhist monks to translate Buddhist texts from Sanskrit to Chinese with the intention that the general populace would then have the ability to practice the Buddhist religion. After his audience with the Emperor, Dat Mo travelled to a monastery in the Kingdom of Wei before finally arriving at the Shaolin temple. When Da Mo initially arrived at Shaolin, he was refused admittance, perhaps because he was considered a foreigner. Rejected by the monks, Da Mo went to a nearby cave and meditated by staring at the cave wall for nine years until the monks recognized his religious prowess and admitted him. Legend has it that he bored a hole through one side of the cave with his constant gaze. Unfortunately, the real reason that Da Mo earned his recognition from the Shaolin monks is lost to history. There is also a story that a local monk was so moved by Dat Mo\'\'s piety that he cut off one of his hands in symaphy. Once admitted to the temple it is believed that Dat Mo found his Chinese disciples too weak, both physically and mentally, to practice the intensive meditation required by his path to enlightenment. Dat Mo is regarded as the founder of Chan Buddhism which is probably better known by its Japanese derivative, Zen Buddhism.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">The Shaolin Temple</h1><p>- To rectify monks\'\' fitness problem, Dat Mo devised exercises combining physical movement and breathing, thus strengthening the bodies and minds of his disciples. This enabled them to pursue the spiritual path with more vigor. Since Dat Mo was himself of the warrior Caste (Ksatriva) it is possible some of the exercises were drawn from the Indian martial tradition. It is evident, therefore that early Shaolin Kung Fu was largely internal in nature, being designed for the improvement of health, control of the mind and the perception of the Buddha nature. The content of this training has come down to the present time as: </p><p>- The Chinese martial arts, and indeed all the martial arts that followed, appear to be the result of a cross-fertilisation between India and China and the passage of people between the two counties. Monks and merchants were constantly making the journey and it is not unreasonable to assume that they required trained body guards or even to learn to defend themselves. Combined with Dat Mo\'\'s intervention at the Shaolin Temple this has lead to what we call Kung Fu today. Lau Gar is a form of Kung Fu and as such can also trace its roots to the Shaolin Temple.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Shaolin Tenchiques</h1><p>- Stances form the foundation for all Kung Fu movements, such as strikes and blocks. Beginners start by learning the stances, then slowly become familiar with kicks, punches, elbow strikes and blocks.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Horse Stance</h1><p>- The horse stance is one of the first things you learn in Kung Fu. It\'s meant to test a beginner\'s mental fortitude more than anything. To do a horse stance, set your feet wider than shoulder-width apart. Point your toes out slightly, then squat down. Your knees should be bent slightly higher than 90 degrees.</p><p>- Some Kung Fu teachers ask their students to hold this position for up to an hour before they begin formal training, to ensure that they have the mental fortitude to practice Kung Fu. While that might be extreme for the average beginner, getting comfortable with this position will pay off in the long run because there are many Kung Fu movements performed from this position.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Other Stances</h1><p>- In Kung Fu, you\'ll learn to string together various stances, punches, blocks and kicks as you get more advanced. In order to combine everything you learn, you have to break down the stances into individual parts and perfect them.</p><p>- There are a few basic stances that you\'ll see often. The forward stance looks like a lateral lunge where you lean on one leg. Cat stance is where you lean on your back leg with the knee bent, bring one hand up to your chest, and hold the other above your head with your arm straight.</p><p>- Twist stance is rather complex. You have to cross one leg over the other and squat down. Crane stance requires balance because you have to stand on one leg and hold the other one in the air with your knee bent.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Punch-Block-Punch</h1><p>- After you learn basic stances, you can practice strikes and blocks. One of the simplest is the punch-block-punch. From either a standing position or horse stance, punch out straight with one arm until your elbow is straight and knuckles face up. Then, flip your hand over and pull your arm back slightly. This is the block.</p><p>- After you block, punch the arm straight out again. This move combines offense and defense. Start slow and, over time, you\'ll be able to increase speed while keeping your technique clean.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Basic Kicks</h1><p>- The basic kicks in Kung Fu are similar to most other martial arts that use kicks. The front kick is the most basic, where you simply thrust your leg forward into the opponent, hitting them with the bottom of your foot.</p><p>- Side kicks are similar to front kicks, but you face perpendicular to the object you want to strike, instead of facing towards it. Front and side kicks are very abbreviated strikes with the power to stop an advancing opponent.</p><p>- For a roundhouse kick, you actually turn your body in the direction you\'re kicking and strike your opponent with your shin or foot. This is a more powerful strike than the front or side kick because you have more time to build momentum.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Tiger Claw Strike</h1><p>- The tiger claw strike is frequently used in tiger style kung fu. Perform this technique by striking your opponent with the heel of your palm. As you strike, your fingers and thumb are bent so that your hand forms a claw. You can hit your opponent in the chin with the tiger claw and then drive your fingers into his eyes. Rake down on his eyes to complete this technique. The tiger claw can also be performed by hitting your opponent’s jaw and then raking down on his ear with your fingers.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Tiger Tail Kick</h1><p>- The tiger tail kick is similar to the spinning back kick used in other styles of martial arts. To perform the tiger tail kick, spin to your right and go down on your left knee. Place your hands on the ground for support. From this position, drive the bottom of your right foot backward at your opponent. This technique is often used to kick prime targets on your opponent’s lower body. For example, you can damage an attacker’s shin, knee or groin with the tiger tail kick.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Tiger Front Sweep</h1><p>- The tiger front sweep is a fast technique that can surprise your opponent if done correctly. To execute this technique, begin in a fighting stance with your left foot in front of your right foot. Crouch down and simultaneously swing your right leg out in front of you. Place your hands on the ground for support as you sweep your opponent’s legs out from underneath him. The tiger front sweep should abruptly take your opponent to the ground.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Tiger and Dragon Go Into Hiding</h1><p>- This technique can be used if your opponent is trying to punch you. If he delivers a punch with his right arm, you can twist to your right to avoid the punch and attack his arm. While keeping your right hand in a claw position, grab his right wrist with your right hand. As you grab his wrist, bring your other palm horizontally across the front of your body and strike his elbow. This technique is meant to break an attacker’s arm. You can simultaneously kick his front knee with the bottom of your right foot as you execute this technique</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Hard Qiqong</h1><p>- Qigong is a way to train the nervous system, the mind and the internal organs all in the same time having as the result an increased level of fitness and power. The aim of Qigong exercise is to stimulate the flow of internal energy called ‘Chi’ through channels (called meridians) and build internal strength.</p><p>- Qigong uses breathing techniques, practices, and disciplines of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, and Martial Arts. These breathing techniques control the internal movement of Chi while the body will be motionless. From Chinese Martial Arts perspective there are techniques known as ‘ Iron Palm’, ‘Iron Shirt’ and ‘Metal Bell Cover’.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Why study Qiqong?</h1><p>- Qigong is the art and the science of using breath, posture, and movement in order to cleanse and circulate the Qi in the body. The benefits are seen in improving health, awareness transformation and increased power of martial artists practitioners (medical and vitality Qigong).</p><p>- In spiritual levels, the exercises help the student to experience other dimensions and to develop telepathic powers. If you practice constantly, you will be able to understand everything that happens to you internally (organs and muscle), be able to feel the changes inside and develop self-control.</p><p>- By using the body and mind with breathing techniques we increase our resistance to diseases, adapt to the environment and improve our immune system (medical Qigong). Having a strong immune system we create a state of vitality and youthfulness (vitality Qigong)</p><p>- Having a strong body will help you in competitions and actual combat (Warrior Qigong). Qi is much more difficult to develop but will last all your life and beyond and increase with practice.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">What will i learn?</h1><p>- You learn to combine your body moves, mind, and breath in order to achieve a peaceful mind. We teach you the requirements for practicing Qi Gong: breathing, controlling your mind and coordinate your body. Hard Qigong exercises consist of: iron palm, arm, body (practice with herbs), break a brick with your palm and wooden sticks on your body. In this class, you will also learn to through knives and needles.</p><p>- Additionally, we teach you Intellectual (intelligence, creativity, memory, decision-making, and prosperity) and Spiritual Qi Gong (spiritual cultivation).</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Health benefits</h1><p>- Qigong is the art and the science of using breath, posture, and movement in order to cleanse and circulate the Qi in the body. The benefits are seen in improving health, awareness transformation and increased power of the practitioners (medical and vitality Qigong).</p><p>- In China, for medical purpose, there two main branches of Qigong: static breathing (including meditation) and moving exercises.</p><p>- In spiritual levels, the exercises help the student to experience other dimensions and to develop telepathic powers. If you practice constantly, you will be able to understand everything that happens to you internally (organs and muscle), be able to feel the changes inside and develop self-control.</p><p>- The best time to practice Qigong is early in the morning, before breakfast. Chinese people like to train in the presence of trees because they get their strength from the nature (earth, water, sun, air) and have a positive field of energy. If you practice during the day, you must allow 30 minutes after meals before starting to practice. The clothing must be comfortable and make sure to remove jewelry which might obstruct the blood flow.</p><p>- The first exercise to warm up is your knees by doing slow rotations for 30 times each side. The next part to warm up is your shoulders by doing 60 full circles.<p>- Qigong practice helps the vital systems to cope with the impact of stressful, polluted and daily lifestyle. If your internal organs function properly, your health will benefit tremendously. You can become more productive when relaxed under pressure. Chinese Traditional Medicine approach is to pay the doctor to keep you healthy and cease the payments if you become ill until healthy again. In Chinese medical tradition, illness is connected to the patterns of energy flow. Pain is a signal of blockage or stagnation in the energy flow. Qigong exercises are designed to enhance the flow of Chi and regulate the internal balance.</p>','<img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin1.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin1\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin2.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin2\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin3.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin3\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin4.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin4\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin5.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin5\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin6.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin6\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin7.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin7\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin8.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin8\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin9.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin9\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin10.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin10\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin11.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin11\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin12.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin12\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin13.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin13\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin14.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin14\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin15.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin15\"<img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin16.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin16\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin17.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin17\"><img src=\"images/shaolin/shaolin18.jpg\" alt=\"shaolin18\">'),(2,2,'<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Introduction to Goju-ryu Karate</h1><p>- Goyju-ryu  Japanese for \"hard-soft style\", is one of the main traditional Okinawan styles of karate, featuring a combination of hard and soft techniques. Both principles, hard and soft, come from the famous martial arts book used by Okinawan masters during the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bubishi (Chinese: Wǔbèi Zhì).[1] Go, which means hard, refers to closed hand techniques or straight linear attacks; jū, which means soft, refers to open hand techniques and circular movements. Goyju-ryu   incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including joint locks, grappling, takedowns, and throws.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Dojo Rules Karate</h1><p>- Always bow when entering or leaving the dojo training area. This also applies to sports halls, etc.</p><p>- If the class has started, kneel and wait to be invited by the instructing sensei to join the class. When joining the class do not walk in front of the sensei or the class. Do not eat, chew gum, drink or smoke in the dojo. Remove all forms of jewellery before beginning training. If you wear a ring that you are unable to remove be sure to cover it with a plaster. Keep your nails short and clean.</p><p>- Bow to your partner before and after training. Do not chat during class. Learn to pay attention. When addressed by the sensei, listen carefully, make sure that you understand the communication, then acknowledge with an affirmative “Yes, Sensei”. There is no place in the organisation for aggressive or dis-courteous behaviour.</p><p>- Goju-ryu Karate is divided in three categories:</p><ol><li>Kihon – basic blocks, punches, kicks and stances</li><li>Kata – prearranged forms simulating combat situations</li><li>Kumite – sparring</li></ol>    <p>- We will always endeavour to :</p><ol><li>Be humble, courteous and honourable.</li><li>Regulate our practice to our physical condition.</li><li>Study and practice only in earnestness.</li> <li>Be composed, tranquil and alert to produce reflex thought and action.</li><li>Take care of our health.</li> <li>Lead simple lives.</li><li>Be united and unceasing in our endeavours in spite of all obstacle</li></ol><p>The study of Karate involves many aspects, an important one of which is dicipline. Students are taught to respect their teacher, fellow students and themselves, to have regard for the society in which we live and to contribute in a positive way. Students learn to dicipline their minds, to enable them to concentrate better and to focus their minds and bodies.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">History of Goju-ryu Karate</h1><p>- Goju-ryu Karate was founded by Higaonna Kanryo (1850–1915).</p><p>- He began by learning Kempo in China under the instruction of Master Ryu Ryuko. He became known as a great martial artist. On his return to Okinawa he began to teach members of the royal family and subsequently opened up his own Dojo. His art became known as Naha-te. He became especially well known for his incredible speed, strength and power.</p><p>- In 1921, he performed a demonstration of Naha-te in Okinawa for the visiting Prince Hirohito, Emperor of Japan and in 1925 for Prince Chichibu. Chojun Miyagi realised the importance of unifying Okinawan Karate so that it could be practiced around the world. The Karate Research Club was established in 1926 in Wakas-Cho. Four instructors, Miyagi Chojun, Hanashiro, Motobu and Mabuni took exercises and also spoke of the samurai code of ethics.</p><p>- Exposure increased after performances at several martial arts tournaments and it became necessary for this art to be named. Therefore, Chojun Miyagi named his martial art Goju-ryu and in 1933 his art of Goju-ryu was formally registered at the Butoku-kai, Japanese Martial Arts Association. The name Goju-ryu (Japanese for \"Hard-soft style\") was chosen because it allows a combination of hard and soft techniques. \'Go\' means hardness or external force \'Ju\' means softness or internal force.</p><p>- The 1930’s saw Goju-ryu actively promoted and developed in Japan and throughout the rest of the world. To improve the physical education of young people and make his style more popular he created the Katas \'Gekisai Dai-ichi\' and \'Gekisai Dai-ni\' in 1940. \'Tensho\' Kata was also created to emphasise the softness of the art and ‘Sanchin\' Kata to emphasise the hardness.The onset of World War II marked a period that saw Miyagi Chojun stop teaching until the end of the war when Okinawan Karate spread rapidly throughout mainland Japan. 1946 saw him begin teaching Karate at the Okinawan Police Academy.</p><p>- He devoted his entire life to the study, development and transmission of Okinawan Karate for the sake of future generations and is truly known as the founder of Goju-ryu Karate-do. During his lifetime, Miyagi Chojun Sensei was known and respected by everyone not only in Okinawa but also respected throughout the world as one of Karate\'s greatest authorities.</p>- As to karate styles, I hear there are two types, the southern type and the northern type. In the aspect of techniques, the southern type specializes in upper body and hand techniques, so it has soft, gentle and quiet features. It is defensive in the fighting. On the other hand, the northern type specializes in lower body and leg techniques, so it has hard and active features. It is aggressive in the fighting. The former steps forward to thrust and steps back to block. The latter steps forward to kick and steps forward again to throw down an opponent. Of course both types thrust, kick and throw down, but the point of view is different each other.</p><p>- Now I would like to tell you about “Heishu” or “Heishu Kata” and “Kaishu” or “Kaishu Kata” to give some information to those who study karate.</p><p>- We also have active version of Sanchin which has another name “Peppuren”. Usually we call Sanchin for both versions. Tanden (= a point a couple of inches below the navel), the back of the head and the buttocks are three focus points on which you have to concentrate your attention during Sanchin exercise.</p><p>- Brief instructions are the following. Tuck your chin in. Lift the back of your head high. Focus on Tanden (= a point a couple of inches below the navel) to charge with the energy. Your buttocks should be tucked in. These three focus points are not originally separated from each other, but have inseparable relationship. In addition to them, there is another focus point: the middle point between the eyebrows.I have heard that principles of Zen and other sitting meditations are the same as Sanchin.</p><p>- When I see karate-do in Okinawa, I think we tend to pay too little attention to “Heishu Kata” such as Sanchin. What do you think of this? Therefore, even if I see your best performance of “Kaishu Kata”, I would not be satisfied with it and I feel something is lacking for perfection, as you do not have a stable and fundamental base powered by Sanchin. Hearing my opinion regarding “Heishu Kata” or Sanchin, Mr. Jingyu, my friend told me an interesting story as follows. “I” in the story is Mr. Jingyu himself, not me.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Stances (Tachi Waza)</h1><ol><li>heisoku dachi: formal attention stance</li><li>musubi dachi: informal attention stance, both heels touching and feet at 45° angle</li><li>heiko dachi: parallel attention stance (e.g. in the kata Kanku Dai)</li><li>hachiji dachi: outward feet stance</li><li>uchi hachiji dachi: inward feet stance; reverse of hachiji dachi</li><li>iaigoshi dachi: kneeling stance (e.g. in the kata Enpi)</li><li>fudo dachi: rooted stance (e.g. in the kata Bassai Dai)</li><li>hangetsu dachi: half-moon stance (e.g. in the kata Hangetsu)</li><li>kiba dachi: horse stance/side stance (e.g. in the Tekki katas)</li><li>kokutsu dachi: back stance (in almost all Shotokan katas; usually first learned in Heian Shodan)</li><li>kosa dachi: cross-legged stance (e.g. in the kata Heian Yondan)</li><li>neko ashi dachi: cat stance (e.g. in the kata Bassai Sho</li><li>mitsurin dachi: jungle stance</li><li>renoji dachi: l-stance, or relaxed stance (e.g. in the kata Kanku Dai)</li><li>teiji dachi: t-stance</li><li>sanchin dachi: hourglass stance (e.g. in the kata Sanchin)</li><li>katashi dachi: crane-like stance (e.g. in the kata Enpi)</li><li>sagi ashi dachi: heron stance (e.g. in the kata Jitte)</li><li>gankaku dachi: crane stance (e.g. in the kata Gankaku)</li><li>tsuru ashi dachi: hanging leg stance</li><li>zenkutsu dachi: front stance</li><li>yoi dachi (usually called Yoi): basic stance/Ready position</li><li>yama dachi: mountain stance (e.g. in the kata Jitte)</li><li>sochin dachi: high-low blocking rooted stance</li></ol><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Blocking techniques (Uke-waza)</h1><ol><li>age-uke: rising block</li><li>gedan morote barai: double sweeping low block (usually while going into kiba dachi)</li><li>haiwan uke: square side block (e.g. in the kata, Heian nidan)</li><li>gedan juji uke: downward x block</li><li>jodan juji uke: upward x block</li><li>kaisho age uke: open-palm rising block</li><li>kaisho haiwan uke: knife-hand square side block (e.g. in the kata, Heian yondan)</li><li>kaisho juji uke: open-palm x block (e.g. in the kata, Heian godan)</li><li>kakiwake uke: floating x block (e.g. in the kata, Heian yondan)</li><li>morote uke: double forearm block (e.g. in the kata, Heian sandan)</li><li>nagashi uke: rising palm sweep block (e.g. in the kata, Tekki shodan)</li><li>osae uke: palm block</li><li>otoshi uke: dropping forearm block</li><li>shuto age uke: rising knife-hand block</li><li>shuto gedan barai: knife-hand sweeping low block</li><li>shuto uke: knife hand block</li><li>shuto mawashi uke (roundhouse block with knife-hand)</li><li>soto uke: outside forearm block</li><li>morote sukui uke: scooping block</li><li>tate shuto uke: half knife-hand block</li><li>te osae uke: dropping palm block</li><li>uchi ude uke / uchi uke: inside forearm block</li><li>gyako uchi uke: reverse outside mid-level (e.g. in the kata, Heian nidan)</li><li>ude barai: reverse sweeping forearm block</li><li>heo tsukami: hair grab (e.g. in the kata, Enpi)</li><li>ushiro gedan barai: back low sweeping block (e.g. in the kata, Enpi)</li><li>teisho uke: palm heel block</li><li>chudan soete uke: added hand inside block (e.g. in the kata, Bassai Dai)</li><li>tsuki uke: punching block</li><li>morote tsukami uke: augmented grabbing/throwing block</li><li>mawashi uke: roundhouse or circle block (e.g. in the kata, Unsu)</li><li>haishu uke: backhand block (e.g. in the kata, Heian godan</li><li>kosa uke (also known as joge uke): cross block (e.g. in the kata, Heian sandan)</li><li>teisho awase uke: hands together block (e.g. in the kata, Gankaku)</li><li>zenwan uke: forearm block</li><li>gedan kaki uke: downward hook block</li><li>joge kaki uke: up & down hook block (e.g. in the kata, Enpi)</li></ol>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Karate Grading System</h1><p>- Gradings are a measure of achievement and students should be encouraged to progress at a pace which stretches them but within achievable limits. They should be rewarded for their efforts and grading with the receipt of that grade and certificate along with a different coloured belt enhances the feel good factor. Children in particular like the recognition they get when wearing a different colour of belt.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Grading Frequency</h1> <p>- It is recommended that gradings should occur every 12 to 13 weeks i.e. 4 times per annum. The student should attend at least 18 training sessions between gradings.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Belt Color System</h1><p>- Adults follow the main belt colour system and children follow this with the inclusion of the intermediate mon grade system. These mon grades should be recognised with the wearing of a contrasting stripe through the whole length of the belt. Experience has shown that the children do not always have to take all three mon grades to achieve the required standard of a whole Kyu (full colour belt) advancement.</p><p>- The following belt system has been adopted by the GKI. It is the case that as the student reaches purple belt and towards brown belt that the length of time between gradings increases to 6 month intervals. This in practice means that the student would rarely need to pass through the mon grades at this stage and that the limited availability of belt colours at this point should not prove a problem. If the student does pass a mon grade then the normal practice of putting a black band at the end of the belt is adopted.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Goju-ryu Karate Skills</h1><p>- All students are taught “warm up” exercises at the beginning of every lesson. These exercises are designed to warm up and loosen all of the muscle groups in the body and can be done at home as well as in the dojo and are vital to any form of physical exercise and especially the martial arts.</p>  <p>- Supplimentary training is also a part of the Goju Ryu karate way using traditional Okinawan training devices.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">CHINSI (stone lever weights)</h1> <p>- The chishi is a concrete or stone weight at the end of a wooden handle. It is mainly used to strengthen the grip, as well as the joints of the elbows, wrists and shoulders. The exercises develop the muscles used in blocking, striking and grappling techniques. It also strengthens the arms, shoulders, abdomen and stance for a variety of techniques. The Chishi is based on the principle of leverage. The leverage of the stone weight at one end of the shaft concentrates the force upon the wrists and isolates the muscles, tendons and joints used in the specific exercise.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">NIGIRI-GAME (gripping jars)</h1><p>- These are gripping jars, usually made of clay with a rim around the top to grip with the fingers. Sand can be added to increase the weight of the jars. Gripping these jars increases the strength of the fingers for gripping and tearing applications. Stepping forwards and backwards in stances is practised with the emphasis on the shoulders being properly down and pulled back.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">MAKIWARA (striking posts)</h1><p>- A makiwara, the most central tool of Okinawa Goju Ryu Karate Do, is a striking post, with a straw, cloth or rubber clad on the contact area. It is constructed of either a combination of 2×4 s or a 4×4 tapered off at the top. It is used to condition the striking surfaces of the body and perfect striking techniques and kime. It is a common misconception to regard the Makiwara as a tool or device for producing enlarged knuckles and callouses on the fists. The callouses are merely an external indication that makiwara training is taking place, The real value is to the wrists and elbow joints and the fixator muscle of the armpit, chest and back. The makiwara is best made of indigenous Okinawa wood called “shi-ja” or of Japanese red oak.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">ICHISASHI (stone padlocks)</h1><p>- This is a stone padlock resembling the shape of an old-fashioned clothes iron. It s is used for strengthening the arms and wrists and developing powerful punches. The Ishisashi is particularly beneficial to the Goju Ryu Sanchin kata training.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">TAN (barbell)</h1><p>- This resembles a barbell, usually made of wood with weights on the ends. It is usually rolled over the forearms and back, or twisted over the hips. It strengthens and conditions the affected areas. The Tan is also used for conventional weight training exercises.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">TOU (cane or bamboo bundles)</h1> <p>- This is a bundle of bamboo sticks taped together at the ends. Before kicking bags were introduced to Okinawa the To fulfilled many of the requirements of the kicking bag. Full power hand and feet techniques are unleashed upon the Tou from static or mobile postures.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">KONGOKEN (oval metal weights)</h1>    <p>- This is a very heavy rectangular hoop, used alone or with a partner. It is used to strengthen the body and condition it for contact. This instrument was developed by Sensei Myagi. It weighs around 70kg. This ring is twisted and pressed around in solo or two man forms and it is intended to give the feeling of handling the weight of a man so that the offensive balance is understood.</p>','<img src=\"images/karate/karate_title_table.png\" alt=\"karate table\"><img src=\"images/karate/karate-img1.jpg\" alt=\"karate-img1\"><img src=\"images/karate/karate-img2.jpg\" alt=\"karate-img2\"><img src=\"images/karate/karate-img3.jpg\" alt=\"karate-img3\"><img src=\"images/karate/karate-img4.jpg\" alt=\"karate-img4\"><img src=\"images/karate/karate-img5.jpg\" alt=\"karate-img5\">'),(3,3,'<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Introduction to Jeet Kune Do </h1><p>- The following are principles that Lee incorporated into Jeet Kune Do. He felt them universal combat truths that were self-evident, and would lead to combat success if followed. Familiarity with each of the \"four ranges of combat\", in particular, is thought to be instrumental in becoming a \"total\" martial artist.</p><p>- JKD believes the best defense is a strong offense, hence the principle of an \"intercepting fist\". For someone to attack another hand-to-hand, the attacker must approach the target. This provides an opportunity for the attacked person to \"intercept\" the attacking movement. The principle of interception may be applied to more than intercepting the actual physical attack; non-verbal cues (subtle movements of which opponent may be unaware) may also be perceived or \"intercepted\", and thus used to one\'s advantage.</p><p>- he \"five ways of attack\", categories which help JKD practitioners organize their fighting repertoire, comprise the offensive teachings of JKD. The concepts of \"Stop hits & stop kicks,\" and \"Simultaneous parrying & punching,\" based on the concept of single fluid motions which attack while defending (in systems such as épée fencing and Wing Chun), compose JKD\'s defensive teachings. These were modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Lee to complement the principle of interception.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Stance</h1><p>- Seen in many of his movie fight scenes such as in the Way of the Dragon vs Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee fought in a side southpaw horse stance. His jabs and crosses came from his right hand and followed up with a lot of side kicks. Instead of a common check seen in muay thai, Bruce uses an oblique leg kick to block a potential kick. He adopted other defensive concepts found in many other systems such as slipping and rolling from Western boxing and forearm blocks found in Eastern martial arts such as Kung Fu.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Footowork</h1><p>- Lee\'s nimble and agile skipping-like footwork is seen in his movies. This technique was adopted from Muhammad Ali\'s footwork in his boxing stance.This footwork can be achieved from practice using a jump rope as jumping rope imitates this nimble, jumpy action that is a quick way to maneuvre your way around and away from an enemy\'s strikes. The footwork also has its influences from fencing.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Straight lead</h1><p>- Lee felt that the straight lead was the most integral part of Jeet Kune Do punching, saying, \"The leading straight punch is the backbone of all punching in Jeet Kune Do.\" The straight lead is not a power strike but a strike formulated for speed. It is believed that the straight lead should always be held loosely with a slight motion, as this adds to its speed and makes it more difficult to see and block. The strike is believed to be not only the fastest punch in JKD, but also the most accurate. The speed is attributed to the fact that the fist is held out slightly making it closer to the target and its accuracy is gained from the punch being thrown straight forward from one\'s centerline. The lead should be held and thrown loosely and easily, tightening only upon impact, adding to one\'s punch. The punch can be thrown from multiple angles and levels</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Jeet Kune Do Introduction</h1><p>- Lee founded the system on July 9, 1967, referring to it as \"non-classical\", suggesting that it is a formless form of Chinese Kung Fu. Unlike more traditional martial arts, Jeet Kune Do is not fixed or patterned and is a philosophy with guiding ideas. Named for the Wing Chun concept of interception or attacking when one\'s opponent is about to attack, Jeet Kune Do\'s practitioners believe in minimal effort with maximum effect and extreme speed.</p><p>- It is referenced in the screenplay of the 1973 Warner Brothers film Enter the Dragon when Lee is asked, \"What\'s your style?\" and he replies, \"My style?...You can call it the art of fighting without fighting.\"</p><p>- Lee believed that kata forms and martial art tournament matches alike (like Karate) were simply \"organised despair\".He believed that in order to \"fully express oneself, one must have no limitations (kata and rigid and non-flowing movements being the limitation.) \"His system was new, and included all possible forms of strikes: attacks to the groin, finger jab to the eye as well as biting.\"</p><p>- The name Jeet Kune Do was often said by Lee to be just a name, and he often referred to it as \"the art of expressing the human body\" in his writings and in interviews. Through his studies Lee came to believe that other styles had become too rigid and unrealistic. He called martial art competitions of the day \"dry land swimming\".He believed real combat was spontaneous, and a martial artist cannot predict it, but only react to it, and a good martial artist should \"be like water\"—move fluidly without hesitation.</p><p>- On January 10, 1996, the Bruce Lee Foundation decided to use the name Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do (振藩截拳道) to refer to the martial arts system which Lee founded; \"Jun Fan\" being Lee\'s Chinese given name.</p><p>- Originally, when Lee began researching various fighting styles, he called it Jun Fan Gung Fu. Not wanting to create another style which would share the limitations that all styles had, he instead described the process which he used to create it:</p><p>- I have not invented a \"new style,\" composite, modified or otherwise that is set within distinct form as apart from \"this\" method or \"that\" method. On the contrary, I hope to free my followers from clinging to styles, patterns, or molds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror in which to see \"ourselves\". . . Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be a member of. Either you understand or you don\'t, and that is that. There is no mystery about my style. My movements are simple, direct and non-classical. The extraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in Jeet Kune Do is being so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it.</p><p>- I always believe that the easy way is the right way. Jeet Kune Do is simply the direct expression of one\'s feelings with the minimum of movements and energy. The closer to the true way of Kung Fu, the less wastage of expression there is. Finally, a Jeet Kune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is exclusively Jeet Kune Do is simply not with it. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case anchored down to reactionary pattern, and naturally is still bound by another modified pattern and can move within its limits. He has not digested the simple fact that truth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive. Again let me remind you Jeet Kune Do is just a name used, a boat to get one across, and once across it is to be discarded and not to be carried on one\'s back.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Jeet Kune Do Techniques</h1><p>- Like the people who run most magazines, we at Black Belt love to look at surveys — in particular, surveys that tell us what you want to read. Back in the 1970s, those surveys told us you were interested in kung fu self-defense moves and jeet kune do moves. In the ’80s, it was taekwondo techniques, ninjutsu techniques and jeet kune do techniques. In the ’90s, it was kenpo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and jeet kune do. In the 2000s, it’s been the mixed martial arts and — you guessed it — jeet kune do. </p><p>- To serve up an article about the one fighting art that has remained on everyone’s radar ever since Bruce Lee began showcasing it in movies, we talked with Ted Wong, the man many claim was Bruce Lee’s No. 1 disciple. In 2006, Ted Wong was inducted into the Black Belt Hall of Fame as Man of the Year for his ongoing efforts to propagate JKD around the world. Who better to turn to for advice on fixing the mistakes students make in their jeet kune do techniques? Sadly, Ted Wong passed away on November 24, 2010. Before his passing, however, he shared with us the 14 mistakes he encountered most often and offered advice from his decades of experience.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #1: Origins</h1><p>- Not all aspects of JKD punching stem from wing chun kung fu, Ted Wong says. “Much of the JKD being taught today is based on wing chun structures. I have a lot of respect for wing chun, but it’s not JKD. In fact, the majority of Bruce Lee’s notes in Tao of Jeet Kune Do are from boxing and fencing. “One of the most important phrases in his notes and in the Tao comes from a boxing book: ‘The essence of fighting is the art of moving at the right time.’ But you have to move and think like a fencer because mobility is the key in JKD or any fighting art.”</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #2: Balance </h1><p>- Bruce Lee taught that the key to balance is having your head positioned vertically over the line that connects your feet, Ted Wong says. “If it’s not and your opponent forces you to move backward, you have nowhere to go while staying balanced.”</p><p>- Even worse, you can’t follow up when your balance is off. You’re basically limited to your initial jeet kune do moves, be it a punch or a kick, because you’re not in a position to throw another one with any power, he says. In some instances — specifically, when your opponent is backing up after your first strike — you’ll need to pursue him with follow-up shots. That’s when you really have to keep your head over the line between your feet so you can quickly close the distance.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #3: Stance </h1><p>- Bruce Lee developed the JKD stance for a reason: It serves a fighter well in the greatest variety of situations. All the more reason not to abandon it as you face different opponents — a grappler, for instance.</p><p>- “If you make your stance too wide, you cannot move,” Ted Wong says. “A grappler will pick you up and throw you to the floor. If you keep the proper stance while your opponent shoots for your front leg, however, you can quickly move back and hit him.” Remember to keep your balance forward for maximum power, he adds. In order to execute jeet kune do moves correctly, you need the proper JKD stance. To construct the right stance, imagine a line between you and your opponent. The toe of your front foot should be on that line, as should the arch of your rear foot. An isosceles triangle is formed with your lead toe at the top and your rear heel and rear toe at the bottom vertexes. “If you have an open stance like a boxer, that line will point away from your opponent, and you’ll lose your power structure,” Ted Wong says. “One key part of JKD is, it’s not how fast you hit or how much muscle you have; it’s that you have that power structure. You have to keep it intact no matter how or where you move. When you’re off, you lose power and mobility.”</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #4: Understanding </h1><p>- You can’t rely on one or two forces in jeet kune do moves. You need three, Ted Wong says. “The first is vertical. Your stance is slightly down to begin with, and then you strike as you rise. It’s normally used in the uppercut. “The second force is linear, which means you’re moving forward. It’s what powers the lead-hand strike.” Obviously, footwork is important to create that forward motion. “The third is rotational,” Ted Wong says. It emanates from twisting your hips and is the force that powers the hook punch and hook kick. </p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #5: Distance</h1><p>- “Perhaps the most common mistake people make when learning JKD is [related to] distance, Ted Wong says. “If you have the wrong distance, you cannot get your technique or combination off, and you might get hit. So it’s critical to be able to judge distance.” The philosophy, which derives from fencing, is simple: Stay far enough out of reach to prevent your foe from touching you with a punch or kick — and from being able to lean and touch you. If he wants to make contact, he’ll have to take a step. Obviously, you’ll have to do the same to reach him, but because you’re trained to close that gap, it’s easier for you.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #6: Timing</h1><p>- “Nobody throws a punch like in JKD,” Ted Wong claims. And that’s why it’s so hard for the average martial artist to master jeet kune do techniques. When developing timing in your jeet kune do moves, Ted Wong advocates memorizing a motto from fencing: Hand before foot always. “You can see reference to it in the Tao,” he says. “Your hand moves before your feet move. It comes from Aldo Nadi, who was a four-time Olympic medalist in fencing. It enables you to bridge the gap and land the shot.”</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #7: Defense</h1><p>- Too many students lean away from their opponent to avoid a punch. Ted Wong calls the remedy to this mistake “half-half sharing.” Instead of merely leaning, your upper body is angled backward to cover half the distance needed for your evasive movement and your footwork covers the other half. That gives you a margin of safety, and it doesn’t leave you out of range or off-balance, either of which could preclude a counterattack, he says.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #8: Flow</h1><p>- Another mistake beginners make is separating their forward step from their lead-hand strike — in essence, they step, plant their foot on the ground and then punch. It’s way too slow, Ted Wong says. The preferred way to execute jeet kune do moves is to make sure that when you land your blow, your front foot isn’t on the ground yet, Ted Wong says. “When you hit, it’s one, two, three. One is your fist hitting his face, two is your front foot hitting the ground and three is your rear foot hitting the ground after the step.” </p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #9: Power Source </h1><p>- The power of your jeet kune do moves should come from your rear leg, not from your arms. “You channel the power from your back leg through your body and into your punch,” Ted Wong says. </p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #10: Angels </h1><p>- Jeet kune do combat isn’t just a back-and-forth exchange of blows. It’s two-dimensional. That second dimension comes from moving off to the side when you’re confronted by an attack. “Angling can put you in a safer position to counter from,” Ted Wong says. “For example, at the same time you move in for a punch to counter your opponent’s punch, you angle to the outside of his arm so he can’t hit you with his counterattack. It’s a built-in safety.”</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #11: Approach</h1><p>-  In JKD, you shouldn’t just step toward your opponent and try to score with a punch, Ted Wong says. Even if you execute the attack correctly, success is hard to come by because he can react before you land the shot. The right way to enter is with a stop-kick — for example, using your lead leg to attack his lead leg or body, whether he’s moving forward or not. Then you launch your punch as your front foot comes down. Make sure to angle off to the outside as you strike, Ted Wong adds.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #12: Punching</h1><p>- Many martial artists throw the rear-hand punch while their fist is vertical, but that creates less than optimal bone alignment, Ted Wong says. The right way according to JKD is to turn your fist so your elbow is pointing slightly up — so your pinkie knuckle is higher than your index-finger knuckle. That orientation aligns the bones in your forearm with the ones in your hands for maximum structural integrity. It also raises your upper arm, which protects your chin. In contrast, if you punch with your fist vertical, your upper arm will be lower, thus exposing your chin to a counterattack. </p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #13: Kicking</h1><p>-  One of the most serious mistakes Ted Wong has identified involves practitioners who lean backward while kicking. It’s bad for many reasons, he says. First, you sacrifice power whenever you lean backward. Second, you probably won’t have a chance to land more than one technique because your arms can’t reach him from your compromised position. “It’s a one-shot deal for you,” he says. Third, you might fall — more than a few fighters have taken a tumble in the ring or on the street because they’re off-balance after such a technique. Fourth, if you have to struggle to avoid falling, you could very well find yourself hopping backward to regain your balance, and that’s not good. In lieu of leaning in your jeet kune do moves, you should keep your balance forward as required by the JKD stance.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Technique #14: Reaching</h1><p>- Punching is a highly effective subset of Bruce Lee’s art, but it’s often sabotaged when beginners lean too far forward to hit in their jeet kune do moves. “In JKD, we start from farther back — just like in fencing — so if all you’re going to do is lean, you won’t make it,” Ted Wong says. “It’s too far, which is why footwork is important to cover the distance. “In boxing, it all takes place within arm’s reach. I touch you and you touch me. But in fencing, if I touch you and you touch me, we both get killed. It’s about who can bridge the gap and get in quicker to score.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Jeet Kune Do Skills</h1><p>- 1. Self-defense skills: Jeet Kune Do practitioners are able to stop an attack before the attacker can even complete their move, and strike back within seconds. Definitely an impressive self-defense technique.</p><p>- 2. Higher confidence: JKD is an excellent exercise that improves flexibility and strength, with the added benefit of self-defense. How can you not feel more confident?</p><p>- 3. Body balance and agility: Because you have to prevail over your opponent using only a few moves, your body learns how to coordinate these moves perfectly so that they are executed fast.</p><p>- 4. Increased alertness and lower reaction time: JKD trains your mind to be alert and ready to counter-attack your opponent before they finish their attack. In time, this will increase your ability to respond to unexpected situations.</p><p>- 5. Adaptability: Adaptability is highly valued and encouraged in Jeet Kune Do. No two opponents are the same. No two methods of attack are the same. </p><p>- Therefore, there’s no predefined path to follow in response. You learn to adapt your defense based on your opponent, and on what your body can do.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\"> Practicing Jeet Kune Do at home</h1><p>- It goes without saying that to master Jeet Kune Do, you must attend classes. There’s no harm in doing some extra Jeet Kune Do training at home, though.</p><p>- Even if you haven’t practiced Jeet Kune Do before, these exercises will help you get started with some basic moves. Do some stretching to warm up your muscles, and you’re ready to go!</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\"> Basic stance</h1><p>- Assuming the Jeet Kune Do stance is essential if you want your body to be ready for an attack or defense. It will also give your opponent as few targets to attack as possible.</p><p>- So, start with leading with your dominant foot turning it slightly inwards, making sure you keep it parallel to the other foot. Both knees should be slightly bent.</p><p>- Have your whole body face the same way and keep your arms close to your ribcage and at chin level, with your hands closed into fists.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Punch like Bruce Lee</h1><p>- One-inch punch: Maybe the most iconic punch of all. With a surprisingly small movement of no more than one inch, you can send your opponent on their way, literally.</p><p>- The theory behind it is a mathematical principle – the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.</p><p>-  Or, in Bruce Lee’s words, “Simplicity is the shortest distance between two points.” Practically, you need to have the correct distance (three to six inches) from your target, keep your wrist straight, and strike fast.</p><p>- To practice this punch, you’ll need a paper bag hanging from a string, or a partner. First, make sure you have assumed the right stance.</p><p>- You should be able to touch your target when you straighten your arm without having to lean forward, and your elbow should be bent at a 45-degree angle.</p><p>- Snapping punch: Another Bruce Lee signature punch. An explosive punch that is executed fast and unexpectedly, where you hit your target and immediately return to the guard position.</p><p>- Again, you’ll need a paper bag or a partner for your practice. Lean forward and keep your lead foot firmly on the ground while you strike your punch.</p><p>- You don’t need to put a lot of power to the strike. You want to have minimum contact with the target, so speed and agility are your weapons here.</p><p>- Your goal is to snap a hole in the bag, penetrating just a couple of inches. During the practice, you can keep your fists in a vertical position.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Low kicks</h1><p>- A hit to your opponent’s leg and morale, since a successful low kick can make them lose their balance and end up on the floor with legs too weak to stand up.</p><p>- If you want to practice your defense at the same time, use a partner.</p><p>- Keep your legs slightly bent, then step forward and at the same time pivot your front foot open to increase the power of the impact, and kick!</p><p>- You must perform the kick with your shin instead of your foot, otherwise you might hurt yourself. </p><p>- You can keep your hands up to defend yourself. Or, you can be more sneaky about it and catch your opponent off guard by throwing a punch at the same time.</p><p>- The punch will distract them, and they won’t see the low kick coming.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Footwork drills</h1><p>- Mobility and speed are essential in Jeet June Do, and footwork offers precisely that.</p><p>- Use it as a part of your attack strategy to puzzle your opponent, and to make their life harder by not being an easy target yourself. </p><p>- JKD footwork involves a wide variety of moves. Instead of analyzing those, we found it more useful to suggest a few drills that will improve your footwork on a physical and on a mental level, too.</p><p>- 1. Jump rope: Yeap, one of the kids’ favorite activities will help you gain full control of how you move your lower body, increase your stamina and agility.</p><p>- Apart from the classic up-and-down jumping, you can also practice side-to-side and forward-backward.</p><p>- 2. Ladder drills: Get one from the store or make your own agility ladder, and train your legs to move in any possible direction with speed, agility, and fluidity.</p><p>- 3. Shadowboxing: If there’s one drill you can do at home by yourself, it’s this. All you have to do is throw punches in the air at an imaginary enemy.</p><p>- Shadowboxing in front of a mirror will help you spot mistakes in your technique. It’s also a great way to mentally prepare for combat – plus, visualizing yourself as the winner boosts your morale!</p><p>- Jeet Kune Do is an amazing martial art and philosophy that teaches a lot more than self-defense. Embrace its true spirit and let it guide you towards living a simple and uncomplicated life, free of mental restraints and unnecessary clutter.</p>','<img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo1.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo1\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo2.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo2\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo3.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo3\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo4.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo4\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo5.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo5\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo6.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo6\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo7.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo7\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo8.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo8\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo9.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo9\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo10.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo10\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo11.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo11\"><img src=\"images/jeetkunedo/jeetkunedo12.jpg\" alt=\"jeetkunedo12\">'),(4,4,'<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Introduction to Aikido</h1><p>- The Japanese martial art of Aikido is a comprehensive system of throwing, joint-locking, striking and pinning techniques, coupled with training in traditional Japanese weapons such as the sword, staff and knife. Founded by Morihei Ueshiba early in the twentieth century following his own extensive study of various armed and unarmed martial systems, Aikido represents a potent distillation of centuries of Japanese martial knowledge. It is one of the most widely practiced budo, or martial way, in the world.</p><p>- However, Ueshiba (commonly called O-Sensei, or ‘venerable teacher’) was determined that his Aikido be practiced as more than simply a method of fighting. The Japanese martial arts, influenced by the internal and meditative disciplines inherited from India and China, have often carried with them an emphasis on the development of internal, as well as physical, integrity.</p><p>- Wielding the life-taking sword with compassion and insight, the ideal warrior in Japanese thought is more than a simple killing machine; he is a model of uprightness, courage and loyalty, gladly sacrificing life (but never honor) in the name of principle and duty. Steeped in these traditions, O-Sensei conceived of Aikido as not only a means of vanquishing a foe, but as a means of promoting the positive character of the ideal warrior and ultimately of transcending dualistic conflict. For O-Sensei, Aikido was a path of self-development. He believed that it could be a means for anyone, of any nation, to follow the same path. Aikido is shugyo: an intense physical and spiritual training to perfect human character and develop true wisdom.</p><p>- Traditional Aikido is non-competitive and promotions do not come through besting an opponent, but through demonstrating understanding of basic exercises and techniques, which become more demanding or difficult as rank increases. In Aikido we strive to work in cooperation with a partner, still employing effective technique against an energetic and realistic attack, yet doing so by blending with the attack and redirecting its energy back to the attacker. We practice techniques against a variety of attacks such as kicks, punches, strikes, single-hand or two-hand grabs from the front or rear, chokes, multiple person attacks, and attacks with weapons. In all of these we strive to resolve the conflict in a non-lethal, non-disruptive, yet effective manner.</p><p>- Techniques may end in joint locks or immobilizations, or in dynamic motions where the attacker is thrown forwards or backwards across the mat, or through the air into a spectacular breakfall. Rather than primarily linear motions, Aikido is comprised of blending, turning, pivoting, circling, and spiraling. We are learning to deal not only with our own energy, but with that of an attacker or another person (or people) as well. Aikido embodies concepts which are at the same time very simple, yet very complex. Because of these and other differences, Aikido can be very challenging to learn, yet at the same time can be very rewarding because it is ultimately bringing us into harmony with ourselves and with our world, and helping us to become more complete and integrated human beings.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">How do i start training in aikido</h1><p>- To start training in Aikido, it is necessary to find a dojo (place to train) near you. Sources of information on dojo location include the internet, phone company yellow pages, street signs, and Aikido-related magazines. You should visit any school you are considering, to see first hand what the school, instructor, students, energy, and training are like. Stay clear of schools who do not let observers in or who do not give you a welcome or comfortable feeling. Remember that the energy or ‘vibes’ of a school comes from that of its members, and those are the people with whom you will be working and training closely. Choose accordingly!</p><p>- The school should also be accredited by a national organization, and the instructors should have legitimate certifications. Ask whether the dojo offers an introductory or trial membership. Some offer introductory-level classes or six- to eight-week sessions as an ‘Introduction to Aikido’. This type of course is a good way for you to try the art and see if it is for you. Once you have found a dojo and decided that you?d like to train or continue training, you should try to attend classes at least two times per week. Once a week is good for a basic introduction, but for actually learning and retaining the material, it is better to attend classes more often, as your schedule and outside commitments allow.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Aikido History</h1><p>- Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平 Ueshiba Morihei, 1883–1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as Ōsensei (Great Teacher).The term aikido was coined in the twentieth century.Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba\'s lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the aiki that Ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.</p><p>- Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.The core martial art from which aikido derives is Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, which Ueshiba studied directly with Takeda Sōkaku, the reviver of that art. Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied Tenjin Shin\'yō-ryū with Tozawa Tokusaburō in Tokyo in 1901, Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū under Nakai Masakatsu in Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with Kiyoichi Takagi (高木 喜代市 Takagi Kiyoichi, 1894–1972) in Tanabe in 1911.</p><p>- The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear (yari), short staff (jō), and possibly the bayonet (銃剣, jūken). Aikido also derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship (kenjutsu).</p><p>- Ueshiba moved to Hokkaidō in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915; His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Daitō-ryū. At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as \"Aiki Budō\". It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society (Dai Nippon Butoku Kai) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Religious influences</h1><p>- After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe.One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one\'s life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba\'s martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.</p><p>- In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.</p><h1 id=\"login-h1\">International dissemination</h1><p>- Aikido was first introduced to the rest of the world in 1951 by Minoru Mochizuki with a visit to France, where he demonstrated aikido techniques to judo students. He was followed by Tadashi Abe in 1952, who came as the official Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years. Kenji Tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953.Later that year, Koichi Tohei was sent by Aikikai Hombu to Hawaii for a full year, where he set up several dōjō. This trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by Hiroshi Tada; and Germany in 1965 by Katsuaki Asai. Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, Masamichi Noro arrived in France in September 1961. Seiichi Sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dōjō throughout the world.</p>','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Aikido Techniques</h1><p>- Aikido techniques are frequently referred to as waza 技 (which is Japanese for technique, art or skill). Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (kata) rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り tori, or shite 仕手, (depending on aikido style) also referred to as (投げ nage (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.</p><ul><li>Boat-rowing exercise (船漕運動, Funakogi undō) / Rowing the boat (取り船, torifune) teaches movement from the hip rather than relying on muscle strength of the arms</li><li>First teaching exercise (一教運動, Ikkyo undō) trains students to enter with both arms forward in the tegatana (手刀) position.</li><li>Body change (体の変更, Tai no henko) altering the direction of an incoming attack</li><li>Seated breathing method (座技呼吸法, Suwariwaza kokyūhō) / Breathing action (呼吸動作, Kokyūdōsa) / Breathing belly method (呼吸丹田方, Kokyūtandenhō) breathing is important in the execution of all aikido techniques. Here \"breathing\" has an additional meaning of \"match with\" or \"accord,\" as the efforts of tori must agree with the direction and strength with which his wrists are held by uke</li></ul><h1 id=\"login-h1\">Training Techniques</h1><ul><li>First teaching (一教, ikkyō) , a control using one hand on the elbow and one hand near the wrist which leverages uke to the ground (also called 腕押さえ , ude osae, \"arm pin\"). This grip also applies pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist.</li><li>Second teaching (二教, nikyō) , a pronating wristlock (小手回し, kote mawashi, \"forearm turn\") that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure. There is an adductive wristlock or Z-lock in ura version.</li><li>Third teaching (三教, sankyō) , a rotational wristlock (小手捻り, kote hineri, \"forearm twist\") that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.</li><li>Fourth teaching (四教, yonkyō) , a shoulder control similar to ikkyō , but with both hands gripping the forearm (also called 小手押さえ, kote osae, \"forearm pin\"). The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient\'s radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone.</li><li>Fifth teaching (五教, gokyō) , visually similar to ikkyō, but with an inverted grip of the wrist, medial rotation of the arm and shoulder, and downward pressure on the elbow (also called 腕伸ばし, ude nobashi). Common in knife and other weapon take-aways.</li><li>Sixth teaching (六教, rokkyō) also called elbow arm-barring pin (肘極め押さえ, hiji kime osae).</li><li>Arm-spraining second teaching (腕挫二教, ude hishigi nikkyo) an elbow lock generally used for knife thrusts or straight punches.</li><li>Four-direction throw (四方投げ, shihōnage) The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.</li><li>Forearm return (小手返し, kotegaeshi) a supinating wristlock-throw that stretches the extensor digitorum.</li><li>Breath throw (呼吸投げ, kokyūnage) a loosely used term for various types of mechanically unrelated techniques, although they generally do not use joint locks like other techniques.</li></ul>l','<h1 id=\"login-h1\">Aikido Skills</h1><p>- Aikido skills are usually a defense against an attack; therefore, to practice aikido with their partner, students must learn to deliver various types of attacks. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based disciplines such as karate or boxing, \"honest\" or \"sincere\" attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of a skill.</p><p>- Many of the strikes (打ち, uchi) of aikido are often said to resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object, which indicates its origins in techniques intended for armed combat. Other techniques, which appear to explicitly be punches (tsuki), are also practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword. Kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:</p><ul><li>Front-of-the-head strike (正面打ち, shōmen\'uchi) a vertical knifehand strike to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the maxillary sinus.</li><li>Side-of-the-head strike (横面打ち, yokomen\'uchi) a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.</li><li>Chest thrust (胸突き, mune-tsuki) a punch to the torso. Specific targets include the chest, abdomen, and solar plexus. Same as \"middle-level thrust\" (中段突き, chūdan-tsuki), and \"direct thrust\" (直突き, choku-tsuki).</li><li>Face thrust (顔面突き, ganmen-tsuki) a punch to the face. Same as \"upper-level thrust\" (上段突き, jōdan-tsuki).</li><li>Sword-taking (太刀取り, tachitori) Being attacked with a sword or bokken, usually reserved for upper level practitioners.</li><li>Knife-taking (短刀取り, tantōtori) Being attacked with a tantō, usually a wooden one.</li><li>Staff-taking (杖取り, jōtori) Being attacked with a jō . Being attacked by any wooden staff is called bōtori(棒取り) or tsuetori(杖取り).</li></ul><p>- Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.</p><ul><li>Single-hand grab (片手取り, katate-dori) one hand grabs one wrist.</li><li>Both-hands grab (諸手取り, morote-dori) both hands grab one wrist. Same as \"single hand double-handed grab\" (片手両手取り, katateryōte-dori)</li><li>Both-hands grab (両手取り, ryōte-dori) both hands grab both wrists. Same as \"double single-handed grab\" (両片手取り, ryōkatate-dori).</li><li>Shoulder grab (肩取り, kata-dori) a shoulder grab. \"Both-shoulders-grab\" is ryōkata-dori (両肩取り). It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as Shoulder grab face strike (肩取り面打ち, kata-dori men-uchi).</li><li>Chest grab (胸取り, mune-dori or muna-dori) grabbing the (clothing of the) chest. Same as \"collar grab\" (襟取り, eri-dori).</li><li>Rear chokehold (後ろ首絞め, ushiro kubishime)</li><li>Rear both shoulders grab (後ろ両肩取り, ushiro ryokatatori)</li><li>Rear both wrists grab (後ろ手首取り, ushiro tekubitori)</li></ul><p>- Aikido makes use of body movement (tai sabaki) to blend with uke. For example, an \"entering\" (irimi) technique consists of movements inward towards uke, while a \"turning\" (転換, tenkan) technique uses a pivoting motion. Additionally, an \"inside\" (内, uchi) technique takes place in front of uke, whereas an \"outside\" (外, soto) technique takes place to his side; a \"front\" (表, omote) technique is applied with motion to the front of uke, and a \"rear\" (裏, ura) version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke, usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (seiza). Techniques where both uke and tori are sitting are called suwari-waza, and techniques performed with uke standing and tori sitting are called hanmi handachi.</p><p>- Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an omote-waza version). Specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\". For instance, katate-dori ikkyō refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as katate-dori ikkyō omote, referring to any forward-moving ikkyō technique from that grab.</p> Atemi (当て身) are strikes (or feints) employed during an aikido technique. Some view atemi as attacks against \"vital points\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, Gōzō Shioda described using atemi in a brawl to quickly down a gang\'s leader. Others consider atemi, especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration. The target may also become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw. Many sayings about atemi are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.</p>','<img src=\"images/aikido/aikido1.jpg\" alt=\"aikido1\"><img src=\"images/aikido/aikido2.jpg\" alt=\"aikido2\"><img src=\"images/aikido/aikido3.jpg\" alt=\"aikido3\"><img src=\"images/aikido/aikido4.jpg\" alt=\"aikido4\"><img src=\"images/aikido/aikido5.jpg\" alt=\"aikido5\"><img src=\"images/aikido/aikido6.jpg\" alt=\"aikido6\">');
